# Sand Box


This is the space where I play the different coding dojos and HackerHank exercises to practice Java based coding skills.

Here its a Java implementation for all the challenges on HackerHank for Java and Problem Solving skills development. The idea is to use the exercise to practice good code design and design patterns implementations in Java. 

Those are definitelly not just the answer from HackerHank and that is not the intention. I will be refactoring on weekly basis some of those classes for a different or optimized solution.
